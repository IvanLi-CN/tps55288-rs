# Roadmap (Short)

## Near-term
- Flesh out STM32G031G8U6 example with actual HAL/Embassy wiring and build/flash instructions.
- Add CI (clippy/format/test incl. async feature) and lefthook pre-commit.
- defmt Display/Format for Error; public type derives already on enums.
- Add mock-based tests for registers (embedded-hal-mock).

## Later
- Publish crate docs with sync/async usage snippets.
- Hardware validation notes and HIL script recipes.
- Versioning and release checklist.
